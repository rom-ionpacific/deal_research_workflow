    """Cold-start work that the first user request would otherwise pay
    for: open a DB connection (TLS to Neon + pool init), and embed a
    throwaway query (OpenAI client + httpx warm-up + Neon pgvector
    page cache for the org embedding HNSW). Without this, the first
    `find_organizations` call after deploy can spike to 60-90s before
    settling to ~1s warm. Best-effort -- any failure prints and gives
    up so the service stays live.

    Uses print() (not logging) because uvicorn's default logger config
    drops INFO from non-uvicorn loggers; the existing slack/events
    breadcrumbs in this app use print() for the same reason.
