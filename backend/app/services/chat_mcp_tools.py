"""MCP-only tools: log a Claude research session as a DealCloud Activity.

DealCloud's "Activity" is the Interaction entity (entry type 5341, synced
read-only today by deal_cloud_enhancer's sync.py::sync_communications).
Writing one requires DealCloud credentials that only deal_cloud_enhancer
holds, so these tools call its `/internal/activities*` endpoints (same
shared-secret pattern as document_body.py's dce call for read_document).

Two-tool confirm flow, both taking the same ResearchActivityInput:
  * draft_research_activity  -- resolves org_ids/deal_id/requester_emails
    and returns the exact preview of what would be submitted. Zero
    DealCloud writes; call this (and re-call it as the user requests
    changes) before ever calling the tool below.
  * create_research_activity -- same resolution, but with confirm=true
    actually performs the DealCloud write. confirm=false (the default) is
    a no-op that just returns the same preview -- a safety net in case the
    model calls this before the user has approved the draft.

Deliberately NOT added to `chat_slack.tools.slack_registry` directly: that
registry is shared verbatim by Todd's Slack bot (chat_slack/orchestrator.py)
and the MCP server (mcp/server.py). Registering write tools there would
silently hand DealCloud-write ability to anyone who can DM Todd. Instead
`mcp_registry` is a clone with these two tools added on top, and only the
MCP server imports it.

## Writing tool descriptions: what may and may not go in one

Tool descriptions and input schemas are CACHED PER USER by claude.ai, and
there is no way for us to invalidate that cache. Each person has to use
Connectors -> ... -> "Refresh tools list" themselves, and until they do they
are steering on whatever text was current when they connected. The MCP
`tools.listChanged` notification does not help: our HTTP transport runs
`stateless=True` (no session to push down), `build_server()` snapshots the
tool list at process start, and the list only ever changes on redeploy --
which restarts the process. There is never a live session whose tool list
changed.

Tool RESPONSES are never cached. So:

  * Description = what the tool IS and when to reach for it. Stable facts
    only.
  * Response (the `note` field every tool here returns) = anything that can
    change: current policy, counts, "don't quote X yet".

Concretely, keep OUT of a description:
  - access/permission claims ("requires the same email", "will refuse
    another person's job", or the inverse "shared across the firm"). Be
    SILENT on policy -- silence cannot go stale, whereas any assertion can,
    in either direction.
  - specific magnitudes that are really server constants (batch sizes, SQL
    LIMITs, row counts, model names). State the RELATIONSHIP instead ("a
    capped handful -- use X for the full list"), which keeps the steering
    without a number that rots.

This is not hypothetical. A description promising "Requires the SAME
requested_by_email ... will refuse another person's job" outlived the gate
it described; the server had stopped refusing, but every user who had not
refreshed still had a tool that told the model to demand an email and expect
a refusal.

# Registry: the Slack surface, with declared divergences, plus MCP-only tools
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# PARITY IS THE GOAL. A tool built for Slack should show up in Claude too,
# with the same implementation. The only reason to diverge is that a tool
# genuinely needs a DIFFERENT implementation over MCP -- and the one real
# case is a tool that calls a model server-side, because an MCP caller IS a
# model and can do that itself (see MCP_REIMPLEMENTED below).
#
# So the surface is declared explicitly rather than inherited blindly: every
# Slack tool must be classified in exactly one bucket below, and
# _assert_surface_declared() fails the build if one isn't. That is the whole
# point -- previously this module did a bare slack_registry.clone(), so
# ask_data_room was exposed over MCP by accident and nobody noticed it needed
# an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY on a service that never had one. A loud build failure
# is the cheap version of that bug.
#
# Adding a Slack tool? Put its name in MCP_INHERITED. That is the default and
# almost always the right answer.

# Same implementation on both surfaces.
