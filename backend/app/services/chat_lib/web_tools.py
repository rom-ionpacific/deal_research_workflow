"""External web tools for chat. Backed by Gemini 2.5 Pro with Google
Search grounding -- same pattern slack_helper/run_ai_updates.py uses for
the AI news digest.

Two tools, registered separately because the two surfaces want different
subsets:

  * `web_search(query)` via `register_web_tools` -- freeform factual
    lookup. In the drw web chat this is registered into a phase registry
    only when the user has explicitly enabled external sources via the
    per-message toggle, so a turn with the toggle off sees no
    `web_search` schema in the tools array at all.
  * `research_company_web(company)` via `register_company_web_tools` --
    a structured public profile of ONE company (what it does, funding,
    people, news, flags). Exists because the recurring ask is "tell me
    about this company, we have nothing internal on them", and letting
    the model improvise that from freeform searches gave inconsistent,
    patchily-sourced answers. Todd (chat_slack) registers both; the web
    chat currently registers only `web_search`.

Output shape: a brief text answer synthesised by Gemini plus a `sources`
list of `{url, title}` so the Claude orchestrator can cite them as
clickable markdown links. We do NOT scrape page bodies -- the synthesised
answer + snippets that Gemini's grounding already gives are enough to
answer most factual lookups without a separate fetch tool.

## Egress

Every call here leaves our perimeter for Google. The PII scrubber that
wraps the MCP server is OUTPUT-only, so it does nothing for an outbound
query -- a tool that sends data out has to police its own INPUT. Hence
`_check_egress`, which hard-refuses queries carrying the two things that
are both confidential and useless to a search engine: email addresses,
and Ion deal codenames ("Project Ostrich"). The model gets told to
rephrase rather than silently having its query rewritten.
